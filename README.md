Welcome to the Data Science Internship Project Showcase repository! This repository is a compilation of data science projects completed during an internship program. Each project demonstrates the application of various data science techniques and methodologies to solve real-world problems and extract actionable insights from data.
# Project Overview
Throughout the internship, I've worked on several projects ranging from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to machine learning model development and evaluation. Each project is organized into its respective folder, containing detailed documentation, code files, and Jupyter notebooks for clarity and reproducibility.
